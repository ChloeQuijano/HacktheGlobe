## Overview
This was my first hackathon and it was a good experience to practice my skills in python programming. We focused on tacklng Crisis Response and found a solution in this category. Our solution was ClarityCare which was a platform that helped in organizing the funds that people had to the charities they were interested in by using a personality survey and matched the person's interest with the charities that had similar goals. We made it to the finals but did not win. 

## Hackathon Challenge
The challenge was to choose 1 of the 6 global issues to compete in, find a problem in that category and create a solution to that issue. A short presentation with a demonstration in our pitch was required as a submission

## Process
- For my part, I made the personality survey. It asked simple questions about finding what charities the user is interested in supporting and the user would rank their interests. Using that data we can match them to the charities that fulfilled those interests giving a list of charities that best fit.
- As well, I collected information from multiple news sites that related to global issues so that it can work alongside the survey to recommend charities that were relevant when a crisis emerged. To achieve this I used Google's News Library and sorted news by their title which could further be parsed through to find topics related to current crisis happening.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I was very happy with the amount of work we did and I'm thankful to my team for their contributions in our final project. Below are a few personal thoughts of this hackathon:
- Wish prior to the hackathon I learnt more about app & website development so that I could get to learn how to make an possible prototype for demonstration
- There was still a lot more we could have done to really show the function of our solution including a visual of the dashboard for how the map & sorting of funds looked to the user. As well, finding how to connect the database we collected with the front end survey we had would have been a nice demonstration but we ran out of time
- For my first hackathon, this was a very different experience because I knew that usually hackathons gave you the problem statement right away (we had to find one) and usually required a devpost to submit (we needed to prepare a presentation & pitch) so our solution had to be very thorough in research. We had around 2 weeks to research and find our problem statement, unfortunately this was in the middle of midterm season so the time I could have spent researching beforehand was limited

## Conclusion
I would really like to thank Global Engineering Week for this opportunity, they organized such a great hackathon! As well, I'm thankful for Lainie from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) for all her help in mentoring our team during the hackathon
